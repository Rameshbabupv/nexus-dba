# NEXUS HRMS - Project Overview

## Project Purpose
The NEXUS HRMS (Human Resource Management System) is an enterprise-grade database project designed to provide a comprehensive foundation for HR management systems. This is specifically the **database architecture component** of a larger HRMS system.

## Architecture Approach
- **Monolithic Modular Design**: Uses Spring Boot + GraphQL + PostgreSQL stack
- **Database-First Approach**: Comprehensive PostgreSQL schema design with performance optimization
- **Multi-Tenant Architecture**: Row Level Security (RLS) with company-based data isolation
- **Performance-Optimized**: Designed to support 500+ concurrent users and 100K+ employee records

## Key Features Covered
1. **Foundation Schema**: Company, location, and user management
2. **Employee Management**: Complete employee lifecycle and master data
3. **Attendance Management**: Time tracking and attendance systems
4. **Leave Management**: Leave applications and approvals
5. **Payroll Management**: Salary calculations and payroll processing
6. **Performance Management**: Appraisals and goal tracking
7. **Recruitment Management**: Hiring pipeline and candidate tracking
8. **Training & Development**: Employee training programs

## Target System Requirements
- **Performance**: Sub-100ms query response times for 95% of operations
- **Scalability**: Support for 500+ concurrent users per company
- **Security**: Multi-tenant with field-level encryption for PII data
- **Compliance**: GDPR-ready with complete audit trails

## Technology Context
This database schema is designed to work with:
- **Backend**: Spring Boot 3.x with modular architecture
- **API Layer**: GraphQL for flexible data access
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with advanced features (RLS, partitioning, GIN indexes)
- **Connection Pooling**: HikariCP with optimized configurations
- **Caching**: Redis for performance optimization
